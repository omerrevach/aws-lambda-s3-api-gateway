                           └── Returns the data to the user


so the task that they gave me is two scenarios.

1. a user makes a post request to the API gateway that triggers the 
   a lambda function then it writes to the s3 bucket what was in the payload.

2. the user makes a get request to the API gateway which 
   triggers lambda and Retrieves and outputs the info in it to the user?



1️⃣ USER MAKES A POST REQUEST (SEND DATA)
   │
   ├──> API Gateway receives the request
   │
   ├──> API Gateway triggers Lambda
   │
   ├──> Lambda writes the payload to "data.json" in S3
   │
   ├──> Lambda responds with {"file_name": "data.json"}
   │
   ├──> API Gateway returns response to the user
   │
   └──> ✅ Data is now stored in S3!


2️⃣ USER MAKES A GET REQUEST (RETRIEVE DATA)
   │
   ├──> API Gateway receives the request
   │
   ├──> API Gateway triggers Lambda
   │
   ├──> Lambda fetches "data.json" from S3
   │
   ├──> Lambda returns the file contents to API Gateway
   │
   ├──> API Gateway sends response back to the user
   │
   └──> ✅ User receives the stored data!
